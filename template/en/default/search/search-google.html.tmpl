  Use the <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> search engine to search 
  for [% terms.Bugzilla +%] [%+ terms.bugs %]. Find the [% terms.bugs %] you are
  looking for by entering words that best describe it.

<p>
  For example, if the [% terms.bug %] you are looking for is a browser crash when 
  you go to a secure web site with an embedded Flash animation, you might search 
  for "crash secure SSL flash".
