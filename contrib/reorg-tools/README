Upstreaming attempt: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616499

Included in this directory is a group of tools we've used for moving components
around in a Bugzilla 3.2 install on bugzilla.mozilla.org.

They may require tweaking if you use them on your own install.  Putting them
here to make it easier to collaborate on them and keep them up-to-date.
Hopefully Bugzilla upstream will be able to just do this from the web UI
eventually.
