==BMO Reorg Plan==

Do the following things, mostly in order (but see "Timing" at the end):

1) Create new classifications using GUI:
   Graveyard (Description: "Old, retired products", sort key: <last>)

2) Rename classifications using GUI:
   Client Support to Other

3) Move products between classification using GUI:
   Grendel from Client Software to Graveyard
   CCK from Unclassified to Graveyard
   Derivatives from Unclassified to Graveyard
   MozillaClassic from Unclassified to Graveyard
   UI: "reclassify" link from the top-level classification list

4) Create new products using GUI:
   Core Graveyard in Graveyard 
     (desc: "Old, retired Core components", closed for entry, no charts)
   MailNews Core in Components
     (desc: "Mail and news components common to Thunderbird and SeaMonkey",
      open for bug entry, create charts)

5) Rename products using GUI, and fix queries using fixqueries.pl:
mysql> update series_categories set name="SeaMonkey (2)" where id=32;
   Mozilla Application Suite to SeaMonkey
   Sumo to support.mozilla.com

5.5) Rename versions and milestones in Toolkit to match Firefox before step 6

6) Sync milestones, versions and groups between products using
syncmsandversions.pl:
   Core -> Core Graveyard (new)
   Core -> MailNews Core (new)
   Firefox -> Toolkit
   Core -> SeaMonkey
   mozilla.org -> Websites (only 1)

6.5) Sync flag inclusions using syncflags.pl:
   Core -> Core Graveyard (new)
   Core -> MailNews Core (new)
   Core -> SeaMonkey
   mozilla.org -> Websites (only 1)

6.7) Allow Firefox flags temporarily in Toolkit: 
    250 | blocking-firefox3       | blocking1.9 - 387
    419 | blocking-firefox3.1     | blocking1.9.1 - 416
     63 | blocking0.8             | blocking1.6 - 69
     76 | blocking0.9             | blocking1.7 - 83
     36 | review                  | review - 4
    356 | wanted-firefox3         | wanted1.9 - 357
    418 | wanted-firefox3.1       | wanted1.9.1 - 417

7) Move components using movecomponent.pl.
   Any instruction beginning "moved from".
   Can't fix the queries for this - oh well
   <Very long list>

8) Rename components using GUI, and fix queries using fixqueries.pl.
   Any instruction beginning "renamed from" or "MailNews: prefix removed".
   <Long list>
  
9) Create new components using GUI.
   Any instruction beginning "new".
   <Long list>

10) Move open bugs using GUI:
    XP Miscellany to Core/General
  
11) Merge components by moving bugs using GUI:
    Any instruction beginning "merge in".
    Merge all bugs, including closed. Delete empty component when done.
    <long list of merges>

12) Close Core Graveyard (and Grendel if necessary) to new bugs

13) Rename Toolkit versions and milestones back (from 5.5)

14) Execute flag mapping SQL using Reed's mapping to update bugs in Toolkit

15) Disable above-listed flags in point 6.7 in Toolkit again
